Concept: 

  You're a captain and the lone survivor of a catastrophic shipwreck that killed all of your crewmates and destroyed your ship. Now on a row boat, you must find and retrieve the lost souls of your crewmates through the wreckage by traversing the mystical underwater world and following the North Star. Once you collect all the souls, your crewmates will be at rest and thus fulfilling your final duties as their captain.
